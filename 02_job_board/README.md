# GraphQL Job Board

This is a project used in the [GraphQL by Example](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-by-example/?referralCode=7ACEB04674F000BAC061) course.

It uses Apollo Server with Express, and GraphQL-Request and Apollo Client as GraphQL clients. The application is used to explain queries, mutations, custom object types, authentication, etc.

## Server

### To install NPM packages
```
    yarn
```

### To start the application at port 9000
```
    npm start
```

## Client

### To install NPM packages
```
    yarn
```

### To start the application at port 3000
```
    npm start
```

### Migration from GraphQL Client to Apollo Client
GraphQL Client is a light weight module but does not allow caching of data
